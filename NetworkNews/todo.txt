* Make sure all IBOutlet objects are correctly released.
* Create list of servers, each with associated groups.  Also have an "all
  servers" entry
* Modify DownloadArticlesTask so that it works with an array of URLs.
* Modify ArticleViewController so that it directly loads news: and nntp: URLs,
  and uses a delegate (or data source) to load up previous and next articles.
  (Will need to handle arrays of URLs for multi-part articles.)
* Investigate using NSOperation to handle the Tasks, including how GCD can be
  used to make things work much more nicely.
